This is the first Odin project: Recipes.  During this project I will demonstrate the HTML knowledge I have gained throughout the course which includes
- Configuring a Github repository and linking it with GIT to my own personal directory on the PC
- Setting up a basic HTML boiler plate
- Configuring a very simple website using only HTML features:  links, texts, lists, and images
